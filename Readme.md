# .Net Core Webjob SDK sample

.Net Core WebJob SDK v3 is used both for Webjobs and for Azure Functions (in their V2 runtime).

This is a sample (mostly for myself) on how to get it up and running as the documentation is still in flux between Webjob SDK v2 and v3.

Included features:

* Webjob setup both running
    * in Azure and
    * locally
* Continuous vs. triggered webjob functions
* Time and event triggered Azure functions
* DI injection for both types of "functions"
